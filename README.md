# HelloWorld
>Hello World codes!<br>

These are some of the **first codes** I had written when I started programming.

### helloworld.c
This is the first ever code I wrote in 2019.<br>

On executing, it prints 
```
Hello! World
```
### hello.c
I made this after getting my basics done.<br>

Type your first name and press enter.<br>
It will greet you with your first name
```
Hello! Ayush
```
<br>
